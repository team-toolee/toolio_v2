Conflict Plan
=============

## What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

1. identify that conflict has arisen
2. laptops down for everyone
3. identify the feelings behind the conflict
4. come to a solution that makes everyone happy

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

1. During a daily stand-up in our group, looks at blocks and check-in about individual progress
2. After lunch check-in to discuss blockers and goals for the afternoon

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

1. If we can't complete step 4 within 30 minutes, we will bring to a TA or instructor.
